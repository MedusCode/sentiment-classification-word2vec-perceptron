# Sentiment Classification with Word2Vec & Perceptron

This project explores sentiment classification using word embeddings (Word2Vec) combined with machine learning algorithms like k-NN, Perceptron, and SVM.

It was developed as part of a university course on machine learning and includes:
- Preprocessing and feature extraction using pretrained Word2Vec vectors
- Custom implementation of the Perceptron and Averaged Perceptron
- Model training, tuning, and evaluation on real-world sentiment data
- Comparison with sklearn classifiers (e.g., SVM)

## Features
- Word embedding extraction and pruning
- Custom Perceptron training loop
- k-NN classifier with error/accuracy analysis
- Support vector machine (SVM) benchmark
- CSV-based input/output for reproducibility

## Technologies
- Python
- NumPy, scikit-learn, Gensim, Pandas
